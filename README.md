# RUEParser - An Unreal Engine Archives & Packages Parsing Library in Rust
A rewrite of [CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse) in Rust.
a parsing library designed specifically for extracting data from archives and packages generated by [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) 4 and 5. It provides extensive support for parsing and processing native data classes such as `UObject`, `UTexture2D`, `UAnimSequence`, `UStaticMesh`, and many more. It also offers abstraction layers that enable developers to customize and type their own package formats, to allow them to work with packages that may have unique requirements or structures.

## Why Rust?
Because I run out every time of the memory when I use the C# version.

## Status
Under development.
**Note**: I am learning Rust with the development of this project
